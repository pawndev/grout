## First Launch and Login

![Grout preview, login flow](.github/resources/user_guide/login.png "Grout preview, login flow")

1. **Protocol** – Choose between HTTP and HTTPS.
2. **Hostname** – Enter your RomM server address without the protocol.
3. **Port (optional)** – If your RomM instance runs on a non-standard port, enter it here.
4. **Username** - Your RomM username.
5. **Password** - Your RomM password.

Use the left and right buttons to cycle through options for Protocol. For the text fields (Hostname, Username,
Password), pressing `A` will open an on-screen keyboard.

Press `Start` to login. If your credentials are correct and Grout can reach your server, you'll move
to the next step. If something goes wrong, you'll get a message telling you what happened, and you can try again.

> [!NOTE]
> **OIDC Users:** If your RomM instance uses OIDC authentication, you can still use Grout by setting a password for your
> user account. Grout will support API Keys once they are available in RomM. For more details,
> see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/rommapp/romm/issues/1767#issuecomment-2744215262).

## Platform Directory Mapping

On this screen, you map your RomM platforms to directories on your device.
This tells Grout where to put the games that you download.

![Grout preview, platform mapping](.github/resources/user_guide/platform_mapping.png "Grout preview, platform mapping")

You'll see a list of all platforms from your RomM instance. For each one, you can select:

- **Skip** – Don't map this platform. Games from this platform won't be available to download.
- **Create {Directory Name}** – Create a new directory for this platform. Grout will automatically suggest directory
  names that match your custom firmware's expected structure.
- **/{Existing Directory}** – Map to an existing directory on your device.

Grout tries to be smart about this. If you already have a directory that matches the platform name, it'll be
pre-selected. If not, it'll suggest creating one with the correct name for your firmware.

Use left/right to cycle through the options for each platform. When you're happy with your mappings, press `Start` to
save. Grout will create any new directories you selected.

You can change these mappings later from the Settings menu.

---

## Main Menu – Platform Selection

![Grout preview, main menu (platforms)](.github/resources/user_guide/platforms.png "Grout preview, main menu (platforms)")

At the top, you'll see "Collections" (if you have any collections set up in RomM). Below that, you'll see all your RomM
platforms – NES, SNES, PlayStation, whatever you've got.

**Navigation:**

- `Up/Down` to scroll through platforms
- `A` to select a platform or collection
- `X` to open Settings
- `Y` to open the Save Sync menu
- `Select` to enter reordering mode
- `B` to quit Grout

**Reordering Platforms:**

![Grout preview, reordering platforms](.github/resources/user_guide/reordering_platforms.png "Grout preview, reordering")

Press `Select` to enter reordering mode. `↕` will appear next to the currently selected platform.

While in this mode:

- `Up/Down` to move the platform one position
- `Left/Right` to move the platform one page at a time
- `A` to place the platform into its new position

Your custom platform order is automatically saved to the config and will persist across sessions.

---

## Collections

![Grout preview, collections list](.github/resources/user_guide/collections.png "Grout preview, collections list")

Grout has two views for collections:

**Platform** – After selecting a collection, you'll see a platform selection screen showing all platforms in that
collection. Select a platform to view games from only that platform.

![Grout preview, collection content - platform](.github/resources/user_guide/collections_platform.png "Grout preview, collection content - platform")

**Unified** – After selecting a collection, you'll immediately see all games from all platforms with platform slugs
shown as prefixes (e.g., `[nes] Tetris`, `[snes] Tetris Battle Gaiden`)

![Grout preview, collection content - unified](.github/resources/user_guide/collections_unified.png "Grout preview, collection content - unified")


> [!WARNING]
> If you skipped a platform in the mapping screen, you won't see games for that platform in your collections.

> [!TIP]
> Regular collections, smart collections, and virtual collections can be toggled on/off in settings.

---

## Game List

![Grout preview, games list](.github/resources/user_guide/games_list.png "Grout preview, games list")

The title bar shows you where you are – either a platform name or a collection name.

If you entered a search query, you'll see `[Search: "your search term"] | Platform / Collection Name`.

![Grout preview, search results](.github/resources/user_guide/search_results.png "Grout preview, search results")

**Navigation and Selection:**

- `Up/Down` to scroll through games
- `Left/Right` to skip entire pages
- `A` to select a single game
- `Select` to enter multi-select mode, then use `A` to select/deselect games
- `X` to open the search keyboard
- `B` to go back

**Multi-Select Mode:**
Press `Select` once to enable multi-select. You'll see checkboxes appear next to each game. Now when you press `A` on a
game, it toggles selection instead of immediately downloading. This is perfect when you want to grab a bunch of games at
once.

Check all the ones you want, then press `Start` to confirm your selections.

![Grout preview, games multi select](.github/resources/user_guide/multi_select.png "Grout preview, games multi select")

> [!TIP]
> Box art must be enabled in settings for it to appear.

---

## Search

Press `X` from any game list to search.

![Grout preview, search](.github/resources/user_guide/search.png "Grout preview, search")

Type your search term using the on-screen keyboard and confirm. The game list will filter to show only matching titles.
The search is case-insensitive and matches anywhere in the game name.

To clear a search and return to the full list, press `B`.

---

## Game Details

> [!TIP]
> This screen will only show if you've enabled "Game Details" in Settings.

![Grout preview, game details](.github/resources/user_guide/game_details.png "Grout preview, game details")

You'll see:

- **Cover art** – The game's box art (if available)
- **Summary** – A description of the game
- **Metadata** – Release date, genres, developers/publishers, game modes, regions, languages, and file size
- **Multi-file indicator** – If the game has multiple files (like multi-disc PlayStation games)
- **QR code** – Scan this to view the game's page on your RomM web interface

From here:

- `A` to download the game
- `B` to go back without downloading

---

## Downloading Games

After you've selected games (either from the game list or game details screen), the download manager kicks in.

![Grout preview, game download](.github/resources/user_guide/download.png "Grout preview, game download")

You'll see a progress bar and a list of games being downloaded. Grout downloads your ROMs directly from RomM to the
appropriate directory on your device. Press `Y` to cancel the download.

**What Happens During Download:**

1. **ROM files are downloaded** – The game files are saved to the correct platform directory you mapped earlier.

2. **Multi-file games are extracted automatically** – If you're downloading a multi-disc game, Grout downloads a zip
   file, extracts it, and creates an M3U playlist file so your emulator can handle disc switching.

3. **Artwork is downloaded** – If "Download Art" is enabled in Settings, Grout downloads box art for each game to your
   artwork directory after the ROMs finish.

4. **Zipped files are extracted automatically** – If "Unzip Downloads" is enabled in Settings, Grout extracts any
   zipped ROMs and deletes the zip file.

If a download fails, Grout will show you which games had problems. Successfully downloaded games stay on your device,
failed downloads get cleaned up.

When everything's done, you're dropped back to the game list. The games you just downloaded are now on your device and
ready to play.

## BIOS Files

> [!TIP]
> This menu will only appear if BIOS Downloads are enabled in settings and if there are BIOS files present in RomM for
> the selected platform.

Many emulators require BIOS files to function properly. Grout can download these files directly from your RomM server to
the correct location on your device.

![Grout preview, BIOS download](.github/resources/user_guide/bios_download.png "Grout preview, BIOS download")

### Accessing BIOS Downloads

From the main platform menu, press `A` on a platform that requires BIOS files. If BIOS files are available for that
platform in your RomM library, you'll see a "BIOS" option in the platform submenu.

### Important Notes

- BIOS files must already be uploaded to your RomM server's firmware library
- Grout uses MD5 hashes to verify file integrity when available
- Downloaded BIOS files are placed in the appropriate location for your custom firmware (NextUI, muOS, or Knulli)

---

## Settings

Press `X` from the main platform menu to access Settings.

![Grout preview, settings](.github/resources/user_guide/settings.png "Grout preview, settings")

### Main Settings

**Game Details** - When set to show, selecting a game shows the details screen first. When set to hide, selecting a game
immediately starts the download. If you know what you want and just want to grab it fast, set this to hide.

**Collections Settings** - Opens a sub-menu for configuring collection display options.
See [Collections Settings](#collections-settings) below.

**Downloaded Games** - Controls how already-downloaded games appear in game lists:

- **Do Nothing** – No special treatment for downloaded games
- **Mark** – Downloaded games are marked with a downward pointing arrow
- **Filter** – Downloaded games are hidden from the list entirely

**Save Sync** - Controls save synchronization behavior:

- **Off** – Save sync is completely disabled
- **Manual** – Save sync is available via the `Y` button from the platform menu

**BIOS Menu** - When set to show, adds a BIOS download option to the platform menu, allowing you to download
required BIOS files for emulators directly from your RomM server.

**Download Art** – When enabled, Grout downloads box art for games after downloading the ROMs. The art goes into your
artwork directory so your frontend can display it.

**Box Art** - When set to show, Grout displays cover art thumbnails next to game names in the game list. Artwork is
automatically cached in the background as you browse. This provides a visual preview similar to your frontend's game
library view.

**Sync Artwork** - Select this option to manually sync artwork for all games across all mapped platforms. Grout will scan
your platforms, identify games that don't have cached artwork, and download cover art from RomM. Useful for pre-caching
artwork or updating your library after adding new games.

**Unzip Downloads** - When enabled, Grout automatically extracts zipped ROMs after downloading. The zip file is deleted
after extraction. Useful if you prefer keeping ROMs uncompressed.

**Language** – Grout is localized! Choose from English, Deutsch, Español, Français, Italiano, Português, Русский, or 日本語. If you notice an issue with a translation or want to help by translating, please let us know!

**Advanced** - Opens a sub-menu for advanced configuration options. See [Advanced Settings](#advanced-settings) below.

### Collections Settings

This sub-menu contains all collection-related configuration:

**Collections** - When set to show, Grout displays regular collections in the main menu.

**Smart Collections** - When set to show, Grout displays smart collections in the main menu.

**Virtual Collections** - When set to show, Grout displays virtual collections in the main menu.

**Collection View** - Controls how collections display their games:

- **Platform** – After selecting a collection, you'll see a platform selection screen showing all platforms in that
  collection. Select a platform to view games from only that platform.
- **Unified** – After selecting a collection, you'll immediately see all games from all platforms with platform slugs
  shown as prefixes (e.g., `[nes] Tecmo Bowl`, `[snes] Super Mario World`)

### Advanced Settings

This sub-menu contains advanced configuration and system settings:

**Directory Mappings** – Change which device directories are mapped to which RomM platforms. This takes you back to
the platform mapping screen that appeared during setup.

**Download Timeout** – How long Grout waits for a single ROM to download before giving up. Useful for large files or
slow connections. Options range from 15 to 120 minutes.

**API Timeout** – How long Grout waits for responses from your RomM server before giving up. If you have a slow
connection or are a completionist with a heavily loaded server, increase this. Options range from 15 to 300 seconds.

**Log Level** – Set to Debug if you're troubleshooting issues and want detailed logs. Otherwise, Error is fine.

**Clear Cache** - Clears all cached artwork from your device. This will free up storage space but artwork will need to
be re-downloaded as you browse. You'll be prompted to confirm before the cache is cleared.

**Info** – View version information, build details, server connection info, and the GitHub repository QR code.

## Save Sync

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature requires RomM v4.5.0 as it relies on an endpoint released in this version.

Save Sync keeps your game saves synchronized between your RomM server and your handheld device.

To access save sync, press `Y` from the platform menu.

### How It Works

When you run Save Sync, Grout:

1. Scans your device for games and their save files
2. Matches them with corresponding ROMs in RomM
3. Compares local and remote save files
4. Syncs saves based on which version is newer

### Sync Logic

For each save file found on your device, Grout determines what action to take:

**When RomM has no save:**

- Your local save is uploaded to RomM (with timestamp appended to filename)

**When you have no local save:**

- RomM's save is downloaded to your device

**When both exist:**

- The newer save (based on last modified time) determines the action.
- If the local save is newer, it is uploaded to RomM with the last modified timestamp appended to the filename
- If the RomM save is newer
    - The current local save is backed up to `.backup/` within the platform's save directory
    - The RomM save is downloaded to your device

**When there's no matching ROM in RomM:**

- The save file is reported as "unmatched" in the sync results

### Emulator Selection

Some platforms (like Game Boy Advance on muOS) support multiple emulators, each with its own save directory.

If Grout detects multiple possible save locations, it will prompt you to select which emulator you're using:

![Grout preview, emulator selection](.github/resources/user_guide/emulator_selection.png "Grout preview, emulator selection")

Choose your active emulator to ensure the correct saves are synced.

### Sync Results

![Grout preview, sync summary](.github/resources/user_guide/sync_summary.png "Grout preview, sync summary")

After syncing, you'll see a summary showing:

- Downloaded saves (from RomM to device)
- Uploaded saves (from device to RomM)
- Unmatched saves (local saves without corresponding ROMs in RomM)
- Any errors that occurred

### Important Notes

- **Save files only:** This works with save files, **NOT** save states
- **Save states conflict:** If you use save states with autoload enabled, disable autoload or delete the state after
  downloading a save, otherwise the emulator will load the state instead
- **User-specific:** Saves are tied to your RomM user account – keep this in mind if you share your RomM account
- **Backup protection:** When a save is downloaded from RomM, the current save is backed up with a timestamp appended to
  the filename to aid in recovery

## Advanced Configuration

### Override Files

For advanced users and developers, Grout supports overriding embedded configuration files with local copies. This allows
you to test new platform mappings, add custom BIOS requirements, or modify input mappings without recompiling the
application.

For complete documentation on how to use override files, see [OVERRIDES.md](OVERRIDES.md).
